# About Zettelbuilder

_Zettlebuilder_ is a static site builder for viewing note files in a simple, format-agnostic way.
It is inspired by the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) and [Evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) note taking styles.

## Philosophy

You like to take notes. Perhaps you've looked at solutions like
[Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) or [Notion](http://notion.so), and felt they were to complicated, restrictive, or expensive.
You're looking for the simplest possible system with the following key features...

### Format agnostic

You take notes in various formats — markdown for quick thoughts, LaTeX/Typst for mathematics, Jupyter/Pluto notebooks for code — the list goes on.

You want the freedom to write notes in whichever formats you like, so long as they can be displayed in a webpage.

### Static site generator

You want a simple, customisable web interface where you can browse all your notes.

Maybe you want a local server that updates your site as you edit with browser auto-reloading.
Maybe you want to publish your notes to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

### Simple and file-based

You want to store your notes as files in folders however you like.

Maybe you have a special note folder, maybe you scatter them everywhere in your home folder.
Maybe you use version control, maybe you don't.

### Cross referencing

You want to cross-reference and share your notes using a link that doesn't break if you reorganise your files.

Maybe you have many small, interlinked notes.
Maybe you just have a few large documents that you want to link to.

### Extensible, no vendor lock in

If your note taking style evolves — maybe you start scanning your hand written notes, or recording voice memos — you want to be able to extend your current system by writing some TypeScript instead of having to abandon it.
