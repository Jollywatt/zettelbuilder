# A note is a set of files

When Zettlebuilder runs, it searches a source directory for notes and generates a static site in a build directory.

Files in the source directory with names of the form `{name}.note.{extension}` are interpreted as _note files_.

A _note_ is a set of note files in the same folder with the same name (but possibly different extensions).
The set of extensions present in a note determine its _type_.

Zettlebuilder lets you implement a _renderer_ for each note type.
Renderers are JavaScript or TypeScript functions that take a note and return HTML.
When Zettlebuilder runs, it creates a single static webpage `{name}.html` for each note using a renderer.
